# Basic-Todo-List
A todo list app I made with vanilla Javascript. I followed [this tutorial by DevEd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttf3CEsEwMQ&t) to get the basic Add and Delete functions working.
I also wanted to try out Heroku, so I was able to deploy it on a temporary server: https://a-todo-list4.herokuapp.com/
It works pretty nicely.
